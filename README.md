ATM Simulation System
This is a simple ATM simulation program created during my 1st semester using the C programming language.
It allows users to perform basic banking operations such as balance inquiry, deposit, and withdrawal through a menu-driven interface.
The system uses predefined account numbers and balances to simulate real ATM transactions.
Features
Balance inquiry for checking available funds
Deposit function to add money to an account
Withdrawal function with insufficient balance check
Menu-driven interface for easy user interaction
Predefined accounts for quick testing and demonstration
Technologies Used
Language: C
Compiler: GCC or any standard C compiler
IDE (optional): Code::Blocks / Dev-C++ / VS Code
How It Works
The user enters an account number (from 101â€“110).
If the account exists, the main ATM menu appears.
The user can:
Check balance
Deposit money
Withdraw money
Exit the system
Balances update dynamically during the session.
Example Run
Enter your account number (101-110): 104

ATM Menu:
1. Balance Inquiry
2. Deposit
3. Withdrawal
4. Exit
Enter your choice: 1
Your total balance is: $800.00
Future Enhancements
Add PIN authentication
Store data in files for persistence
Support multiple users concurrently
Add transaction history feature
